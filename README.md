Now-a-days, health sector is using  numerous autonomous machines which are designed using most advanced software. One of the outcomes of this Ideology is “Predicting Cardiovascular diseases using Machine learning algorithms”. Heart Diseases are among the ones which humans can’t detect by themselves; they need many test results to determine the condition of heart. Combining Machine learning techniques with health care for predicting heart diseases would make a good contribution to this field. Classification techniques that were applied to the dataset through the machine learning classification algorithm namely model incorporates boosting and bagging algorithms to provide the accurate results with minimal errors. These models enhance the accuracy level of these classification techniques. For enhancement of the result, dataset is divided into bags for each bag individual machine algorithm is applied, each bag produces accuracy. The final accuracy is calculated based on the votes of the bag’s accuracy. We’ve chosen KNN, Logistic regression, Bagging Classifier, Gradient Boosting, Voting Classifier, Bagging Classifier for predicting the results. These models help us to enhance the result and get the most accurate results. Addition to these we’ve also used Ensemble methods which are Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, Voting.
